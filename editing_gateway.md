# Updating a Direct Link gateway
{: #update-dl-gateway}
{: help} 
{: support}

You can update a Direct Link gateway either before or after the gateway is moved to **Provisioned** state. However, a gateway is restricted from editing during **In review** and some **In progress** states.
{:shortdesc}

To edit a Direct Link gateway, follow these steps:

1. Click **Actions** on the gateway's details page and then click **Edit**. A page with the gateway's details is shown.
2. Update the Direct Link name, link speed, and routing option, as needed.
3. Read and agree to the **Direct Link prerequisites**.
4. Click **Submit** for your changes to take effect.

If you modify the speed or routing option, the pricing is updated.
