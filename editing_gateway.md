# Updating a Direct Link gateway

You can update a Direct Link gateway either before or after the gateway is moved to `Provisioned` state. However, keep in mind that a gateway is restricted from editing during some `In Progress` states.
{:shortdesc}

To edit a Direct Link gateway, follow these steps:

1. Click **Actions** on the gateway's details page and then click **Edit**. A page with the gateway's details is shown.
2. Update the Direct Link name, link speed, and routing option, as needed.
3. Review and select **I accept IBM's Privacy statement and Terms and Conditions**.
4. Click **Submit** for your changes to take effect.

If you modify the speed or routing option, the pricing is changed accordingly.
