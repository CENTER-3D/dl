# Leveraging ECMP for redundant connections
{: #more-about-ecmp} 

Equal-cost multipath (ECMP) is a feature of border gateway protocol (BGP). Some customers asked us about using ECMP as a way to achieve redundancy. However, ECMP alone is not sufficient. This section explains why.

ECMP isnâ€™t designed for creating redundant connections but for balancing the load over two links. With ECMP on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, both connections must terminate to the same IBM Cloud cross-connect router (XCR), which makes it a single point of failure. (In other words, ECMP can be provisioned as two sessions only on the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} XCR).
