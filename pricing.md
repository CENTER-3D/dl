## Arranging for Direct Link connectivity
{: #arranging-for-dl-conectivity}

You, the customer, must arrange connectivity and billing with your service providers, independently of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Direct Link Dedicated creates a Letter Of Authorization / Connecting Facility Assignment (LOA/CFA), which is usable by any service provider who can reach the Meet Me Room that is specified on that LOA/CFA. The provider who is connecting to the LOA/CFA must include pricing for the cross-connect in their quote to you; {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} does not order cross-connects on behalf of any customer.
